# Project Overview
This project is a personal linktree page for Vikash, designed to consolidate various social media and contact links in one place. The page features a loading animation, light/dark mode toggle, and dynamic content such as animated text. The design is responsive and includes smooth transitions and animations.

## Files Included

### 1. `index.html`
The main HTML file for the Linktree-style page, which includes links to various social media profiles and contact options. This file also includes a toggle for light and dark modes, a typing animation for dynamic text, and a modal for sending messages via WhatsApp.

### 2. `loading.html`
A simple HTML file to display a loader animation while the page is loading. It uses jQuery to fade out the loader once the main content is fully loaded.

### 3. `style.css`
The stylesheet for the project, containing styles for:
- The overall layout and appearance of the Linktree page
- Light and dark mode themes
- Loader animation styles
- Modal styles for the WhatsApp message interface
- Typing animation for dynamic text
- Transition effects and hover states for interactive elements

### 4. `script.js`
The JavaScript file containing the functionality for:
- Toggling light and dark modes
- Displaying the loader animation during page load
- Handling link copying to the clipboard and showing a notification
- Implementing the Web Share API
- Managing the WhatsApp message modal, including opening, closing, and sending messages

### 5. `profile.gif`
A compressed GIF file used as the profile picture on the main page. The GIF is optimized for faster loading times.
